## Data Fields Explanation

### Demographic Data
- **age**: Participant's age (18-65)
- **education**: Highest education level completed
- **profession**: Current profession from comprehensive list (50+ options)
- **visualization**: General familiarity with interpreting graphs and data visualizations (1-5 scale)
- **visualizationBackground**: Detailed experience level with data visualizations (6 categories from "No formal exposure" to "Expert")
- **visualImpairment**: Any visual impairments or color vision deficiencies affecting chart viewing
- **chartFamiliarity**: Specific familiarity ratings for each chart type
  - **barCharts**: Familiarity with bar charts (1-5 scale)
  - **lineCharts**: Familiarity with line charts (1-5 scale)
  - **scatterplots**: Familiarity with scatterplots (1-5 scale)
  - **geographicalMaps**: Familiarity with geographical maps (1-5 scale)

### Response Data (per chart)
- **chartId**: The actual chart number from the images folder (1-45)
- **chartIndex**: Display order for this participant (1-8)
- **chartCategory**: The visualization type category (e.g., "Single-class Scatterplots")
- **understanding**: Open-ended response to "What can you understand from the graph given?"
- **factors**: Open-ended response to "What factors/features drive your understanding?"
- **difficultyScale**: Numeric rating 1-5 (1=Very Easy, 5=Very Difficult)
- **difficultyText**: Optional elaboration on difficulty level

### Session Metadata
- **sessionId**: Unique identifier for this study session
- **selectedCharts**: Array of the 8 randomly selected chart IDs
- **completedAt**: ISO timestamp when study was completed
- **totalTimeMinutes**: Total time spent on the study (if available)

## Chart Selection Logic
- **Stratified Random Sampling**: Each participant gets exactly one chart from each of the 8 categories
- **Randomization**: 
  1. One chart is randomly selected from each category (ensuring balanced representation)
  2. The 8 selected charts are then shuffled to randomize presentation order
  3. Each session gets a unique combination while maintaining category balance
- **Chart Categories** (40 total charts):
  1. Single-class Scatterplots: Charts 1-5 (5 charts)
  2. Multi-class Scatterplots: Charts 6-10 (5 charts)
  3. Single-class Line Charts: Charts 11-15 (5 charts)
  4. Multi-class Line Charts: Charts 16-20 (5 charts)
  5. Single-class Bar Graphs: Charts 21-25 (5 charts)
  6. Multi-class Bar Graphs: Charts 26-30 (5 charts)
  7. Single-class Maps: Charts 31-35 (5 charts)
  8. Multi-class Maps: Charts 36-40 (5 charts)
- **Example**: Participant A might get [3, 7, 13, 18, 22, 28, 34, 41] â†’ shuffled to [22, 3, 41, 7, 13, 34, 18, 28]
- **Guarantee**: Every participant sees exactly one chart from each visualization type, but the specific charts and order are randomized
- Charts are referenced by their filename number (1_chart.png = chartId 1)

## Validation Rules
- All demographic fields are required (age, education, profession, visualization familiarity, background, visual impairment)
- All chart familiarity ratings are required (bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, geographical maps)
- Understanding and factors questions require text responses
- Difficulty scale requires selection (1-5)
- Difficulty text is optional

## Visualization Background Categories
1. **No formal exposure** - No training or regular encounters with data visualizations
2. **Basic exposure** - Occasional viewing in media/reports without deep interpretation
3. **Moderate exposure** - Regular interaction with Excel charts, dashboards as part of work/study
4. **Trained in basic data visualization** - At least one course/workshop on reading or designing visualizations
5. **Frequent user of visual data** - Regular analysis/creation in academic, professional, or research contexts
6. **Expert / Professional visualization designer or analyst** - Designs complex visualizations or teaches others
