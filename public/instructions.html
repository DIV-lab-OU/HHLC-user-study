      <h2>Instructions for the HHLC User Study:</h2>
      <p>In this study, you will be shown <strong>8 different visualizations</strong> representing various types of data representations: scatterplots, line charts, bar graphs, and maps—each in both single-class and multi-class forms. For each visualization, you will answer <strong>three questions</strong> designed to understand how you interpret and comprehend visual data representations.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>For each visualization, you will be asked:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Understanding Question</strong> — "What can you understand from the graph given?" Please describe in your own words what the visualization shows you.</li>
  <li><strong>Factors Question</strong> — "What factors/features drive your understanding?" Please explain what specific elements, patterns, or features help you understand the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Difficulty Question</strong> — "Your difficulty level in interpreting this graph?" Please rate from 1-5 (Very Easy to Very Difficult) and optionally elaborate on any challenges.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<p>
There are <strong>no time limits</strong> for this study. Please take your time to provide thoughtful responses. Your honest and detailed answers will help us understand how people with different backgrounds interpret visualizations.
</p>
