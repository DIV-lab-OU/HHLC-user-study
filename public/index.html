      <p>The purpose of our study is to investigate how individuals with diverse cognitive backgrounds interpret various types of data visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and geographic mapsâ€”each in both single-class and multi-class forms. By presenting randomized stimuli across these visualization types and collecting open-ended responses, we aim to understand how people extract meaning, recognize patterns, and reason about data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Being in a research study is completely voluntary. You can choose not to be in this research study. You can also say yes now and change your mind later. Note that if you end the study before completing it, your data will not be recorded.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you agree to take part in this research, you will be shown a series of visualizations and asked questions about your interpretation and understanding. Your participation in this study will take approximately 15-20 minutes. You can choose to stop taking the survey at any time. You must be at least 18 years old to participate.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The possible risks to you in taking part in this research are minimal and relate primarily to confidentiality. The possible benefits include contributing to research that will help design more accessible and effective visual representations for diverse audiences.</p>
      <br>
