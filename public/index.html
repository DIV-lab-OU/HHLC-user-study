        The purpose of our study is to investigate how individuals with diverse individual differences interpret various types of data visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and geographic maps. By presenting randomized stimuli across these visualization types and collecting open-ended responses, we aim to understand how people extract meaning, recognize patterns, and reason about data.
